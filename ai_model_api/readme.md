# Customer Support Chatbot with Fine-Tuned GPT-2

This repository contains a **Customer Support Chatbot** powered by a **fine-tuned GPT-2** model. The chatbot is designed to answer support-related queries based on a custom dataset, which you can use to train and fine-tune the model on your own customer service data.

The chatbot responds with relevant answers or provides fallback support contact information when it cannot answer a question.

├── chatbot.py                      # Contains chatbot logic to generate responses using GPT-2
├── trainModel.py                   # Fine-tuning script for training GPT-2 on your custom dataset
├── gpt2-finetuned-support          # Directory containing the fine-tuned model and tokenizer
├── support\_faq.txt                 # A text file containing customer support questions and responses
├── requirements.txt                # List of dependencies required for the project

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** for installing dependencies

### Install Dependencies

Clone the repository and install the required Python libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/support-chatbot.git
cd support-chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## How It Works

### 1. Fine-Tuning the Model (`trainModel.py`)

The **`trainModel.py`** file allows you to fine-tune the **GPT-2** model on your custom dataset (e.g., customer support queries and responses). The fine-tuned model is saved in the **`gpt2-finetuned-support`** directory.

#### To fine-tune the model:

1. Prepare your custom dataset of customer support queries and responses.
2. Run `trainModel.py` to train the model on your dataset.
3. The fine-tuned model and tokenizer will be saved in the `./gpt2-finetuned-support` directory.

Run the training script:

```bash
python trainModel.py
```

---

### 2. Generating Responses with Fine-Tuned GPT-2 (`chatbot.py`)

The **`chatbot.py`** file contains the logic to load the fine-tuned GPT-2 model and generate responses to support queries.

To generate a response using the fine-tuned model, you can use the `generate_support_response` function:

```python
from chatbot import generate_support_response

response = generate_support_response("How can I reset my password?")
print(response)
```

This function uses the fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate responses in a support context.

---

### 3. Running the Chatbot API (`app.py`)

The **`app.py`** file is a **Flask API** that listens for POST requests at the `/support` endpoint. It generates responses using the fine-tuned GPT-2 model and returns them as JSON.

To run the Flask API, execute the following:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the server is running, you can test the chatbot API using `curl` or Postman.

---

## API Usage

### POST Request to `/support`

You can send a **POST** request to `http://localhost:5000/support` with the user's query in JSON format.

#### Example Request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/support -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "How can I track my order?"}'
```

#### Example Response:

```json
{
  "response": "You can track your order through the tracking link provided in the order confirmation email."
}
```

If the model doesn’t know the answer, it will fallback to:

```json
{
  "response": "For further assistance, please reach out to our support team at support@example.com."
}
```

---

## Model Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune the model, you need a dataset containing **pairs of customer support queries** and their corresponding **responses**.

You can prepare your dataset in text format like **`support_faq.txt`** or **`chat_data.txt`**. These files should contain simple query-response pairs:

* **User Query**: The question or inquiry the user might ask.
* **Support Response**: The answer the support agent should provide.

For example, your dataset might look like this:

```
How can I reset my password? => To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' on the login page.
What is your return policy? => We offer a 30-day return policy. You can return items by contacting support.
```

## Requirements

The following libraries are required for this project:

* `transformers`: For using the GPT-2 model and tokenizer.
* `torch`: To perform deep learning tasks using PyTorch.
* `flask`: To create the API for serving the chatbot.

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhance Fine-Tuning**: Further fine-tune the model with a larger and more diverse dataset of customer queries.
2. **Add More Support Data**: Expand the dataset with more support queries to improve the accuracy of responses.
3. **User Interface**: Build a user-friendly web interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
4. **Multilingual Support**: Add support for multiple languages by training on multilingual datasets.
5. **Deploy to Cloud**: Host the application and model on cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku) for scalability.
